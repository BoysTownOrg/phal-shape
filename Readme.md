- STLAnalysis_JASA: to run the code in this folder, add it and it's subfolders to the Matlab path.
    - Shape_Part1.m - requires the Image Processing Toolbox from Mathworks, and gridtrimesh from matlabcentral fileexchange (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14646-gridtrimesh). 
        - code to analyze ear-canal shape based on reading a STL file from a digital scan of the outer ear and ear canal. See comment in code for additional details.
            - At some point, the Matlab volumeSegmenter app will open. Please read comments in the file do12_JASA.m in the utilities folder beginning on line 107 for detailed instructions. Also refer to official Matlab documentation for the app.
    - Shape_Part2.m - requires the Image Processing Toolbox and Curve Fitting Toolbox from Mathworks
        - This script analyses the ear-canal shape functions including area function, eccentricity, curvature, and torsion. It reads a MAT file with individual ear shape data saved by Shape_Part1. See comment in code for additional details.
- STLs_JASA 
    - STL (stereolithography) files output by the handheld scanner. These provide the raw data for further analysis. The relevant fields in the file A001_Ax_002R_20210414_1030_training.training_L3DS-19-0043_5.2.0.801_Mo1.stl are the first one (A001) which give the subject ID, and the third field (002R), the last letter of which indicates the ear.
